<h1>FAQ</h1>

<p />
<h5>Why does program X fail to read the merged data?</h5>
Try using the standardized versions of the output files, available in the
results page. The process of standardization only keeps the q, I and err
columns (first three columns) of the output files. If there are multiple
points at the same q value, they are averaged so that in the standardized
output file, each line has a different q value.
<p />

<h5>Why are the "Input colored merge plots" not shown?</h5>
Because your output level (advanced options) is too low. Try increasing it,
and the webserver will happily plot the data for you.
<p />

<h5>Where is the legend for the "Input colored merge plots"?</h5>
You will find it in the "Input plots". The colors match.
<p />

<h5>Why are the "Input plots" not shown?</h5>
Because you forgot to tick the box "Output data for parsed input files as
well".
<p />

<h5>How are the profiles rescaled to one another</h5>
Internally, the curves are rescaled to the last one, but for the final
output, their values are rescaled so that I(0) ~ 100
